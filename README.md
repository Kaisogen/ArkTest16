# ArkTest16
Short, Educational C Progams. Compiled on the Raspberry Pi 2 B, this is primarily for people who don't know any C and need some example code to use.

# Usage
There are no precompiled builds of these programs. Instead, install gcc. Compile them yourself, and open it in a terminal using ./[Program Name].

# Compilation
Clone the repository, and unzip it to a new location. Use cd path/to/repo/, and then enter the following command:
    gcc -o ArkTest16 main.c
    
It should produce a program you can open in the terminal.
