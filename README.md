# ArkTest16
A short C test because I'm an idiot and have zero idea what I'm doing

# Usage
Okay, but why? This is mainly for me to just mess around and publicize some simple code for people new to C.

# Compilation
Clone the repository, and unzip it to a new location. Use cd path/to/repo/, and then enter the following command:
    gcc -o ArkTest16 main.c
    
It should produce a program you can open in the terminal.
