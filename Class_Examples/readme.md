# Class Examples

I'll be hosting some volunteer classes at a nearby college on C basics. I'm hosting the examples and code here, as a reference to students.

# Compilation

Navigate to a folder, and use the following command

> gcc main.c app.out

> ./app.out

This should open the compiled application.
